# Module one Capstone Project

> Project Description.

> In this Capstone project, we were given  a design guide line to follow which was based on an art conference but I have personalized it i.e changed the content to that of a technical conference advocating for Renewable Power Generation that has zero net carbon emission. 
> The webpage is responsive and compartible with screen sizes lower than 768px, then higher screen sizes.
